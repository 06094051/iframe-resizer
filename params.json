{"name":"Iframe-resizer","tagline":"jQuery pluggin for cross domain sizing iframes to content with support for window resizing.","body":"Cross domain iframe resizer\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is a simple plugin to enable the resizing of cross domain iframes to fit the contained content. This package contains two minified JavaScript files in the <a href=\"js\">js</a> folder. The first (<a href=\"jquery.iframeResizer.min.js\">jquery.iframeResizer.min.js</a>) is a jQuery plugin for the page hosting the iframe and the second one (<a href=\"iframeResizer.contentWindow.min.js\">iframeResizer.contentWindow.min.js</a>) is a plain self contained JavaScript file that needs placing in the page contained within your iframe.\r\n\r\nThis plugin is built using the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.postMessage\">window.postMessage API</a> to pass messages between the host page and the iframe. To see this working take a look at the <a href=\"example/index.html\">example</a> and watch the console log.\r\n\r\nThe code supports resizing the iframe when the browser window changes size or the content of the iframe changes. For this to work you need to set one of the dimensions to a percentage and tell the plugin only to update the other dimension. Normally you would set the width to 100% and have the height scale to fit the content. To set the plugin up for this create a basic iframe tag with the following options.\r\n\r\n`<iframe src=\"http://anotherdomain.com/frame.content.html\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>`\r\n\r\nNote that scrolling is set to 'no', as older versions of IE don't allow this to be turned off in code and can just slightly add a bit of extra space to the bottom of the content that it doesn't report when it returns the height.\r\n\r\nNext we initialise the plugin on the host page. This example shows all the default options and the values returned to the callback function.\r\n\r\n\t$('iframe').iFrameSizer({\r\n\t\t\t\tlog: false,\r\n\t\t\t\tcontentWindowBodyMargin:8,\r\n\t\t\t\tdoHeight:true,\r\n\t\t\t\tdoWidth:false,\r\n\t\t\t\tenablePublicMethods:false,\r\n\t\t\t\tinterval:0,\r\n\t\t\t\tcallback:function(messageData){\r\n\t\t\t\t\t$('p#callback').html('<b>Frame ID:</b> ' + messageData.iframe.id + \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t' <b>Height:</b> ' + messageData.height + \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t' <b>Width:</b> ' + messageData.width);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\r\nThe `contentWindowBodyMagin` setting is used to override the default browser body tag style. As we can not reliably read this value and it's not included in the figure returned by `document.body.offsetHeight`. So the only way we can work this out is to set it, 8px is the default option in firefox. However, you will most likely want to set this to zero so that the content of you iframe is at the edge of the iframe.\r\n\r\nSetting the `log` option to true will make the scripts in both the host page and the iframe output everything they do to the JavaScript console so you can see the communication between the two scripts.\r\n\r\n###Dynamic content in iframe\r\n\r\nIn most browsers the resize event only fires when the browser window resizes. This means that dynamic changes to the document that change the size of the content don't trigger any events. To overcome this limitation this plugin offers two options that can be set to enable functions in the iFrame. \r\n\r\nThe preferred option is to set `enablePublicMethods` to true. This creates a `window.iFrameResizer` object in the browser. Then when ever the content is changed in the iFrame you can call the following method to have the iFrame resize to the new content.\r\n\r\n\tif (window.iFrameSizer && window.iFrameSizer.trigger) {\r\n\t\twindow.iFrameSizer.trigger();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nAs a secondary option in cases where it is not possible to modify the existing JavaScript you can set an interval timer in the iframe to check changes to the content. This is done by setting the  `interval` option to a numeric value other than zero, the suggested value is 32, which causes the check to run every other screen refresh. Higher values lead to the screen redraw becoming noticeable to the user.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Not all browsers allow the postmessage API to work with locally hosted files.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
